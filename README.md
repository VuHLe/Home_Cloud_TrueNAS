# Home_Cloud_TrueNAS

Configured a custom cloud server by installing 10 TB of HDD, enhancing data storage capabilities and achieving rapid access speeds with an upgraded configuration featuring 16 GB RAM and Ryzen 7 CPU

Installing TrueNAS OS to manage my home server setting, then using TailScale, built on WireGuard, to create the mesh VPN and tunnel to multiple devices, so I can access my server from anywhere outside of my network, which is convinience and more secure.
